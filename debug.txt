Steps to debug

uncomment yydebug lines in c_compiler.cpp

in terminal:
//open gdb
gdb bin/c_compiler

//write file you want to test, remove 'f5.c' if u want to test all folder
set args --translate c_translator/formative/f5.c

//set breakpoint to the line where we print the ast e.g.
break c_compiler.cpp:23

uncomment yydebug lines in print_canonical.cpp

in terminal:
//open gdb
gdb bin/print_canonical

//write file you want to test, remove '.c' if u want to test all folder
set args --S compiler_tests/default/ADD0.c

//set breakpoint to the line where we print the ast e.g.
break print_canonical.cpp:18




//run the program in gdb
run

//gdb commands
p <variable> e.g. p varList, prints current variable state
s, step 
quit, end program 
c, continue (run until an error occurs)
n, next
