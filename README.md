# C to Python Translator and C to MIPS Assembly Compiler

This repository contains two language processors implemented in C++. These processors are part of the Language Processors module taught at Imperial College London. The processors are:

1. C to Python Translator
2. C to MIPS Assembly Compiler

## C to Python Translator
The C to Python Translator is a program that translates C code into equivalent Python code. It helps developers to migrate existing C codebases to Python or understand the functionality of C code by providing a Python equivalent.

## Usage
To use the C to Python Translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the C to Python Translator directory
3. Compile the source code: g++ -o translator translator.cpp
4. Run the translator with the input C file: ./translator input.c
5. Make sure to replace input.c with the path to your desired C file.

## Features
The C to Python Translator supports the following features:

- Basic variable declarations and assignments
- Arithmetic and logical expressions
- Control flow statements (if, else, while, for)
- Functions and function calls

## C to MIPS Assembly Compiler
The C to MIPS Assembly Compiler is a program that compiles C code into MIPS assembly language. MIPS assembly is a low-level language used for programming MIPS processors.

## Usage
To use the C to MIPS Assembly Compiler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the C to MIPS Compiler directory
3. Compile the source code: g++ -o compiler compiler.cpp
4. Run the compiler with the input C file: ./compiler input.c
5. Make sure to replace input.c with the path to your desired C file.

## Features
The C to MIPS Assembly Compiler supports the following features:

- Basic variable declarations and assignments
- Arithmetic and logical expressions
- Control flow statements (if, else, while, for)
- Functions and function calls
